Both of these can lead to confidently inaccurate and irrelevant output. This behavior is known as “hallucination.” In this article, we’ll explore the limitations of foundation models and how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can address these limitations so chat, search, and agentic workflows can all benefit. Limitations of foundation models Products built on top of foundation models alone are brilliant yet flawed as foundation models have multiple limitations: Knowledge cutoffs When you ask current models about recent events – like asking about last week’s NBA basketball game or how to use features in the latest iPhone model - they may confidently provide outdated or completely fabricated information, the hallucinations we mentioned earlier. Models are trained on massive datasets containing years of human knowledge and creative output from code repositories, books, websites, conversations, scientific papers, and more. But after a model is trained, this data is frozen at a specific point in time, the “cutoff”. This cutoff creates a knowledge gap , leading them to generate plausible but incorrect responses when asked about recent developments.

Lack depth in domain-specific knowledge Foundation models have broad knowledge, but can lack depth in specialized domains. High quality datasets might not exist publicly for a domain, not necessarily because they are private, but because they are highly specialized. Consider a medical model that knows about anatomy, disease, and surgical techniques, but struggles with rare genetic conditions and cutting edge therapies. This data might exist publicly to be used during training, but it may not appear enough to train the model correctly. It also requires expert-level knowledge during the training process to contextualize the information. This limitation can result in responses that are incomplete or irrelevant. Lack private or proprietary data In the case of general-purpose, public models, the data ( your data) does not exist publicly and is inaccessible during training. This means that models don’t know the specifics of your business, whether that be internal company processes and policies, personnel data or email communications, or even the trade secrets of your company. And for good reason: if this data had been included in the training, anyone using the model would potentially gain access to your company’s private and proprietary data.

Given that models are trained on vast amounts of public data, there is a chance that the generated response is the result of an unauthoritative source. When inaccurate, irrelevant, and useless information is generated, users will lose trust in the model itself, even when this behavior is inherent in how foundation models work. Output generation is probabilistic Hallucinations are often a symptom of the limitations just described. However, models are trained on a diverse set of data that can contain contradictions, errors, and ambiguous data (in addition to the correct data). Because of this, models assign probabilities to all possible continuations, even the wrong ones. Because of sampling randomness like temperature and top k combined with how a user constructs a prompt (maybe it’s too vague or contains misleading context), models may choose the wrong continuation. The result is output that can contain hallucinations.

These foundation model limitations can impact your business bottom line and erode the trust of your users. Retrieval-augmented generation can address these limitations. What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation? Retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, is a technique that uses authoritative, external data to improve the accuracy, relevancy, and usefulness of a model’s output. It does this through the following four core components, which we’ll cover in more detail later in this article: Ingestion: authoritative data like company proprietary data is loaded into a data source, like a Pinecone vector database Retrieval: relevant data is retrieved from an external data source based on a user query Augmentation: the retrieved data and the user query are combined into a prompt to provide the model with context for the generation step Generation: the model generates output from the augmented prompt, using the context to drive a more accurate and relevant response.

Agents as orchestrators of RAG bring even more opportunities for review, revision of queries, reasoning or validation of context, allowing them to make better decisions, take more informed actions, and generate more accurate and relevant output. Now that we’ve covered what RAG is, let’s take a deeper dive into how it works. How does Retrieval-Augmented Generation work? RAG brings accuracy and relevancy to LLM output by relying on authoritative data sources like proprietary, domain-specific data and real-time information. But before we dig into how it does that, let’s ask the questions: do you even need RAG and how will you know it’s working? This is where ground truth evaluations come in. In order to properly deploy any application, you need to know when it's working. AI applications are no different, and so identifying a set of queries and their expected answers is critical to knowing if your application is working. Maintaining that evaluation set is also critical to knowing where to improve over time, and whether those improvements are working. RAG itself is just one optimization, but there are others like query rewriting, chunk expansion, knowledge graphs and more.

RAG itself is just one optimization, but there are others like query rewriting, chunk expansion, knowledge graphs and more. With a good baseline, you can move on to implementing the four main components of RAG: Ingestion In simple traditional RAG, you’ll retrieve data from a vector database like Pinecone, using semantic search to find the true meaning of the user’s query and retrieve relevant information instead of simply matching keywords in the query. We’ll use Pinecone as an example here, but the concept applies to all vector databases. But before we can retrieve the data, you have to ingest the data. Here are steps to get data into your database: Chunk the data During the ingestion step, you’ll load your authoritative data as vectors into Pinecone. You may have structured or unstructured data in the form of text, PDFs, emails, internal wikis, or databases. After cleaning the data, you may need to chunk it by dividing each piece of data, or document, into smaller chunks. Depending on the kind of data you have, the types of queries your users have, and how the results will be used in your application, you’ll need to choose a chunking strategy .

Create vector embeddings Then, using an embedding model, you’ll embed each chunk and load it into the vector database. The embedding model is a special type of LLM that converts the data chunk into a vector embedding, a numerical representation of the data’s meaning. This allows computers to search for similar items based on the vector representation of the stored data. Load data into a vector database Once you have vectors, you’ll load them into a vector database. This ingestion step most likely happens offline, independently of your application and your user’s workflow. However, if your data changes, for instance, product inventory is updated, you can update the index in real-time to provide up-to-date information to your users. Now that your vector database contains the vector embeddings of your source data, the next step is retrieval. Retrieval A simple approach to retrieval would use semantic search alone. But by using hybrid search, combining both semantic search (with dense vectors) and lexical search (with sparse vectors ), you can improve the retrieval results even more. This becomes relevant when your users don’t always use the same language to talk about a topic (semantic search) and they refer to internal, domain-specific language (lexical or keyword search) like acronyms, product names, or team names.

In hybrid search , you’ll query either a single hybrid index or both a dense and a sparse index. Then we combine and de-duplicate the results and use a reranking model to rerank them based on a unified relevance score, and return the most relevant matches. Augmentation Now that you have the most relevant matches from the retrieval step, you’ll create an augmented prompt with both the search results and the user’s query to send to the LLM. This is where the magic happens. An augmented prompt might look like this: [CODEBLOCK] [CODEBLOCK] QUESTION: <the user's question> CONTEXT: <the search results to use as context> Using the CONTEXT provided, answer the QUESTION. Keep your answer grounded in the facts of the CONTEXT. If the CONTEXT doesn't contain the answer to the QUESTION, say you don't know.

But RAG is no longer simply about searching for the right piece of information to inform a model response. With agentic RAG, it's about deciding which questions to ask, which tools to use, when to use them, and then aggregating results to ground answers. Agentic RAG In this simple version, the LLM is the agent and decides which retrieval tools to use and when, and how to query those tools.

In the context of building LLM-related applications, chunking is the process of breaking down large text into smaller segments called chunks. It’s an essential preprocessing technique that helps optimize the relevance of the content ultimately stored in a vector database. The trick lies in finding chunks that are big enough to contain meaningful information, while small enough to enable performant applications and low latency responses for workloads such as retrieval augmented generation and agentic workflows. In this post, we’ll explore several chunking methods and discuss the tradeoffs needed when choosing a chunking size and method. Finally, we’ll give some recommendations for determining the best chunk size and method that will be appropriate for your application.

There are two big reasons why chunking is necessary for any application involving vector databases or LLMs: to ensure embedding models can fit the data into their context windows, and to ensure the chunks themselves contain the information necessary for search.

All embedding models have context windows, which determine the amount of information in tokens that can be processed into a single fixed size vector. Exceeding this context window may means the excess tokens are truncated, or thrown away, before being processed into a vector. This is potentially harmful as important context could be removed from the representation of the text, which prevents it from being surfaced during a search. Furthermore, it isn’t enough just to right-size your data for a model; the resulting chunks must contain information that is relevant to search over. If the chunk contains a set of sentences that aren’t useful without context, they may not be surfaced when querying! Chunking’s role in semantic search For example, in semantic search, we index a corpus of documents, with each document containing valuable information on a specific topic. Due to the way embedding models work, those documents will need to be chunked, and similarity is determined by chunk-level comparisons to the input query vector. Then, these similar chunks are returned back to the user. By finding an effective chunking strategy, we can ensure our search results accurately capture the essence of the user’s query.

By finding an effective chunking strategy, we can ensure our search results accurately capture the essence of the user’s query. If our chunks are too small or too large, it may lead to imprecise search results or missed opportunities to surface relevant content. As a rule of thumb, if the chunk of text makes sense without the surrounding context to a human, it will make sense to the language model as well. Therefore, finding the optimal chunk size for the documents in the corpus is crucial to ensuring that the search results are accurate and relevant. Chunking’s role for agentic applications and retrieval-augmented generation Agents may need access to up-to-date information from databases in order to call tools, make decisions, and respond to user queries. Chunks returned from searches over databases consume context during a session, and ground the agent’s responses. We use the embedded chunks to build the context based on a knowledge base the agent has access to. This context grounds the agent in trusted information. Similar to how semantic search relies on a good chunking strategy to provide usable outputs, agentic applications need meaningful chunks of information in order to proceed. If an agent is misinformed, or provided information without sufficient context, it may waste tokens generating hallucinations or calling the wrong tools.

The Role of Chunking for Long Context LLMs In some cases, like when using o1 or Claude 4 Sonnet with a 200k context window, un-chunked documents may still fit in context. Still, using large chunks may increase latency and cost in downstream responses. Moreover, long context embedding and LLM models suffer fro m the lost-in-the-middle problem , where relevant information buried inside long documents is missed, even when included in generation. The solution to this problem is ensuring the optimal amount of information is passed to a downstream LLM, which necessarily reduces latency and ensures quality. What should we think about when choosing a chunking strategy? Several variables play a role in determining the best chunking strategy, and these variables vary depending on the use case. Here are some key aspects to keep in mind: What kind of data is being chunked? Are you working with long documents, such as articles or books, or shorter content, like tweets, product descriptions, or chat messages? Small documents may not need to be chunked at all, while larger ones may exhibit certain structure that will inform chunking strategy, such as sub-headers or chapters.

And, the way these models are trained can strongly affect how they perform in practice. After choosing an appropriate model for your domain, be sure to adapt your chunking strategy to align with expected document types the model has been trained on. What are your expectations for the length and complexity of user queries? Will they be short and specific or long and complex? This may inform the way you choose to chunk your content as well so that there’s a closer correlation between the embedded query and embedded chunks. How will the retrieved results be utilized within your specific application? For example, will they be used for semantic search, question answering, retrieval augmented generation, or even an agentic workflow? For example, the amount of information a human may review from a search result may be smaller or larger than what an LLM may need to generate a response.

Embedding short and long content When we embed content, we can expect distinct behaviors depending on whether the content is short (like sentences) or long (like paragraphs or entire documents). When a sentence is embedded, the resulting vector focuses on the sentence’s specific meaning. This could be handy in situations where the vector search is used for (sentence-level) classification, recommendation systems, or applications that allow for searches over shorter summaries before longer documents are processed. The search process is then, finding sentences similar in meaning to query sentences or questions. In cases where sentences themselves are considered individual documents, you wouldn’t need to chunk at all! When a full paragraph or document is embedded, the embedding process considers both the overall context and the relationships between the sentences and phrases within the text. This can result in a more comprehensive vector representation that captures the broader meaning and themes of the text. Larger input text sizes, on the other hand, may introduce noise or dilute the significance of individual sentences or phrases, making finding precise matches when querying the index more difficult. These chunks help support use cases such as question-answering, where answers may be a few paragraphs or more.

Many modern AI applications work with longer documents, which almost always require chunking. Chunking methods Fixed-size chunking This is the most common and straightforward approach to chunking: we simply decide the number of tokens in our chunk, and use this number to break up our documents into fixed size chunks. Usually, this number is the max context window size of the embedding model (such as 1024 for llama-text-embed-v2, or 8196 for text-embedding-3-small). Keep in mind that different embedding models may tokenize text differently, so you will need to estimate token counts accurately. Fixed-sized chunking will be the best path in most cases, and we recommend starting here and iterating only after determining it insufficient. “Content-aware” Chunking Although fixed-size chunking is quite easy to implement, it can ignore critical structure within documents that can be used to inform relevant chunks. Content-aware chunking refers to strategies that adhere to structure to help inform the meaning of our chunks. Simple Sentence and Paragraph splitting As we mentioned before, some embedding models are optimized for embedding sentence-level content. But sometimes, sentences need to be mined from larger text datasets that aren’t preprocessed. In these cases, it’s necessary to use sentence chunking, and there are several approaches and tools available to do this: Naive splitting: The most naive approach would be to split sentences by periods (“.”), new lines, or white space.

NLTK : The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a popular Python library for working with human language data. It provides a trained sentence tokenizer that can split the text into sentences, helping to create more meaningful chunks. spaCy : spaCy is another powerful Python library for NLP tasks. It offers a sophisticated sentence segmentation feature that can efficiently divide the text into separate sentences, enabling better context preservation in the resulting chunks. Recursive Character Level Chunking LangChain implements a RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter that tries to split text using separators in a given order. The default behavior of the splitter uses the [\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"] separators to break paragraphs, sentences and words depending on a given chunk size. This is a great middle ground between always splitting on a specific character and using a more semantic splitter, while also ensuring fixed chunk sizes when possible. Document structure-based chunking When chunking large documents such as PDFs, DOCX, HTML, code snippets, Markdown files and LaTex, specialized chunking methods can help preserve the original structure of the content during chunk creation.

Roll your own parser, or use LangChain splitters here to process these for chunking Markdown : Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used for formatting text. By recognizing the Markdown syntax (e.g., headings, lists, and code blocks), you can intelligently divide the content based on its structure and hierarchy, resulting in more semantically coherent chunks. LaTex : LaTeX is a document preparation system and markup language often used for academic papers and technical documents. By parsing the LaTeX commands and environments, you can create chunks that respect the logical organization of the content (e.g., sections, subsections, and equations), leading to more accurate and contextually relevant results.

Semantic Chunking A new experimental technique for approaching chunking was first introduced by Greg Kamradt . In his notebook , Kamradt rightfully points to the fact that a global chunking size may be too trivial of a mechanism to take into account the meaning of segments within the document. If we use this type of mechanism, we can’t know if we’re combining segments that have anything to do with one another. Luckily, if you’re building an application with LLMs, you most likely already have the ability to create embeddings - and embeddings can be used to extract the semantic meaning present in your data. This semantic analysis can be used to create chunks that are made up of sentences that talk about the same theme or topic. Semantic chunking involves breaking a document into sentences, grouping each sentence with its surrounding sentences, and generating embeddings for these groups. By comparing the semantic distance between each group and its predecessor, you can identify where the topic or theme shifts, which defines the chunk boundaries. You can learn more about applying semantic chunking with Pinecone here. Contextual Chunking with LLMs Sometimes, it’s not possible to chunk information from a larger complex document without losing the context entirely. This can happen when the documents are many hundreds of pages, change topics frequently, or require understanding from many related portions of the document.

Anthropic introduced contextual retrieval in 2024 to help address this problem. Anthropic prompted a Claude instance with an entire document and it’s chunk, in order to generate a contextualized description, which is appended to the chunk and then embedded. The description helps retain the high-level summary meaning of the document to the chunk, which exposes this information to incoming queries. To avoid processing the document each time, it’s cached within the prompt for all necessary chunks. You can learn more about contextual retrieval in our video here and our code example here. Figuring out the best chunking strategy for your application Here are some pointers to help decide a strategy if fixed chunking doesn’t easily apply to your use case. Selecting a Range of Chunk Sizes - Once your data is preprocessed, the next step is to choose a range of potential chunk sizes to test. As mentioned previously, the choice should take into account the nature of the content (e.g., short messages or lengthy documents), the embedding model you’ll use, and its capabilities (e.g., token limits). The objective is to find a balance between preserving context and maintaining accuracy. Start by exploring a variety of chunk sizes, including smaller chunks (e.g., 128 or 256 tokens) for capturing more granular semantic information and larger chunks (e.g., 512 or 1024 tokens)", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.pinecone.io/learn/chunking-strategies/", "title": "Chunking Strategies for LLM Applications", "date": "6/28/2025", "type": "blog", "author": "Pinecone"}}

Evaluating the Performance of Each Chunk Size - In order to test various chunk sizes, you can either use multiple indices or a single index with multiple namespaces . With a representative dataset, create the embeddings for the chunk sizes you want to test and save them in your index (or indices). You can then run a series of queries for which you can evaluate quality, and compare the performance of the various chunk sizes. This is most likely to be an iterative process, where you test different chunk sizes against different queries until you can determine the best-performing chunk size for your content and expected queries. Post-processing chunks with chunk expansion It’s important to remember that you aren’t entirely married to your chunking strategy. When querying chunked data in a vector database, the retrieved information is typically the top semantically similar chunks given a user query. But users, agents or LLMs may need more surrounding context in order to adequately interpret the chunk. Chunk expansion is an easy way to post-process chunked data from a database, by retrieving neighboring chunks within a window for each chunk in a retrieved set of chunks.

As we delve into more advanced applications of AI, such as image recognition, voice search, or recommendation engines, the nature of data becomes more intricate. Here's where vector databases come into play. Unlike traditional databases that store scalar values, vector databases are uniquely designed to handle multi-dimensional data points, often termed vectors. These vectors, representing data in numerous dimensions, can be thought of as arrows pointing in a particular direction and magnitude in space. As the digital age propels us into an era dominated by AI and machine learning, vector databases have emerged as indispensable tools for storing, searching, and analyzing high-dimensional data vectors.

This data, which could include text, images, audio, and video, is transformed into vectors using various processes like machine learning models, word embeddings, or feature extraction techniques. The primary benefit of a vector database is its ability to swiftly and precisely locate and retrieve data according to their vector proximity or resemblance. This allows for searches rooted in semantic or contextual relevance rather than relying solely on exact matches or set criteria as with conventional databases. For instance, with a vector database, you can: Search for songs that resonate with a particular tune based on melody and rhythm. Discover articles that align with another specific article in theme and perspective. Identify gadgets that mirror the characteristics and reviews of a certain device. How Does a Vector Database Work? Traditional databases store simple data like words and numbers in a table format. Vector databases, however, work with complex data called vectors and use unique methods for searching. While regular databases search for exact data matches, vector databases look for the closest match using specific measures of similarity. Vector databases use special search techniques known as Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, which includes methods like hashing and graph-based searches.

Vector databases use special search techniques known as Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, which includes methods like hashing and graph-based searches. To really understand how vector databases work and how it is different from traditional relational databases like SQL , we have to first understand the concept of embeddings. Unstructured data, such as text, images, and audio, lacks a predefined format, posing challenges for traditional databases. To leverage this data in artificial intelligence and machine learning applications, it's transformed into numerical representations using embeddings. Embedding is like giving each item, whether it's a word, image, or something else, a unique code that captures its meaning or essence. This code helps computers understand and compare these items in a more efficient and meaningful way. Think of it as turning a complicated book into a short summary that still captures the main points. This embedding process is typically achieved using a special kind of neural network designed for the task. For example, word embeddings convert words into vectors in such a way that words with similar meanings are closer in the vector space. This transformation allows algorithms to understand relationships and similarities between items. Essentially, embeddings serve as a bridge, converting non-numeric data into a form that machine learning models can work with, enabling them to discern patterns and relationships in the data more effectively.

As AI models, especially those in the domain of natural language processing and computer vision, generate and work with these vectors, the need for efficient storage and retrieval systems has become paramount. This is where vector databases come into play, providing a highly optimized environment for these AI-driven applications. A prime example of this relationship between AI and vector databases is observed in the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 . These models are designed to understand and generate human-like text by processing vast amounts of data, transforming them into high-dimensional vectors. Applications built on GPT and similar models rely heavily on vector databases to manage and query these vectors efficiently. The reason for this reliance lies in the sheer volume and complexity of data these models handle. Given the substantial parameter increase, models like GPT-4 generate a vast amount of vectorized data, which can be challenging for conventional databases to process efficiently. This underscores the importance of specialized vector databases capable of", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.datacamp.com/blog/the-top-5-vector-databases", "title": "The Top 7 Vector Databases in 2025", "date": "1/18/2025", "type": "blog", "author": "DataCamp"}}

Get Certified, Get Hired FAQs How are vector databases different from traditional relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL? Vector databases are designed to handle high-dimensional data, such as embeddings produced by AI models. Unlike relational databases, which rely on structured tables and exact matches, vector databases focus on similarity searches, enabling them to retrieve semantically or contextually related data points. Can vector databases replace traditional databases? No, vector databases complement traditional databases rather than replace them. While traditional databases excel at managing structured data and supporting transactional operations, vector databases are specialized tools for handling and searching unstructured, high-dimensional data like text embeddings, images, or audio. What are Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms, and why are they essential in vector databases? ANN algorithms are specialized methods for quickly finding vectors that are closest to a given query vector in high-dimensional space. They balance speed and accuracy, making them ideal for large datasets where exact nearest neighbor searches would be computationally expensive. Are vector databases suitable for small-scale projects or only for large enterprises? Vector databases are versatile and can be used in both small and large projects. For small-scale projects, open-source solutions like Chroma, Faiss, and Weaviate offer robust capabilities. For enterprise-scale projects, managed platforms like Pinecone provide scalability and performance optimization. How does vector database performance scale with increasing data size? Performance scalability depends on the underlying architecture and indexing techniques, such as HNSW or IVF.
